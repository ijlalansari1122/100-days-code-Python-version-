# Task 1: Functions and Loops
# Create a function called print_square_table that takes a number as an argument and prints a table of squares from 1 to that number.
#
#
#
# num1 =int(input("please enter a number "))
# def print_square_table(x):
#   for i in range(1,x+1):
#     print(f'{i} squared is {pow(i,2)}')
#
#
# print_square_table(num1)
# Example: If the input is 5, the function should print:
# csharp
# Copy code
# 1 squared is 1
# 2 squared is 4
# 3 squared is 9
# 4 squared is 16
# 5 squared is 25
# Call the print_square_table function with different numbers to see the tables for those numbers.
